# AFTER STATE — PASSES CARBON GATE
# All three remediations applied:
#   [1] Early stopping + reduced epochs
#   [2] Smaller model (hidden_dim, num_layers)
#   [3] Caching + fast_dev_run + smaller dataset
experiment_name: "pass_after_fix"
seed: 42

# Dataset — reduced for PR checks
dataset_size: 500           # FIX 3: was 8000
input_dim: 32
num_classes: 8

# Model — right-sized for the task
hidden_dim: 128             # FIX 2: was 256
num_layers: 3               # FIX 2: was 6

# Training — early stopping reduces wasted epochs
epochs: 10                  # FIX 1: was 40
batch_size: 64
learning_rate: 0.0005

# Evaluation — much less frequent
eval_every_n_steps: 50      # FIX 3: was 1

# Caching — enabled
use_cache: true             # FIX 3: was false

# Early stopping — enabled
early_stopping: true        # FIX 1: was false
patience: 3                 # stop if val_loss doesn't improve for 3 epochs

# Fast dev run — enabled (one-batch smoke test for PR checks)
fast_dev_run: true          # FIX 3: was false
